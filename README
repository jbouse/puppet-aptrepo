Anticipated goal is to be able to define APT repositories as such

    aptrepo { 
        'lenny':
            ensure     => "present",
            type       => "deb",
            url        => "http://http.us.debian.org/debian",
            dist       => "lenny",
            components => ["main", "contrib"];
        'lenny-source':
            ensure     => "absent",
            type       => "deb-src",
            url        => "http://http.us.debian.org/debian",
            dist       => "lenny",
            components => ["main", "contrib"];
    }
