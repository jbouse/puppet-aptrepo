Anticipated goal is to be able to define APT repositories as such

    aptrepo { 
        'lenny':
            ensure       => "present",
            type         => "deb",
            uri          => "http://http.us.debian.org/debian",
            distribution => "lenny",
            components   => ["main", "contrib"];
        'lenny-source':
            ensure       => "absent",
            type         => "deb-src",
            uri          => "http://http.us.debian.org/debian",
            distribution => "lenny",
            components   => ["main", "contrib"];
    }
